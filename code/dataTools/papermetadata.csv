A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II,"K. Deb, A. Pratap, S. Agarwal, T. Meyarivan, ",2002,10932,996017,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/996017/,"Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use non-dominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1) their O(MN/sup 3/) computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism approach; and (3) the need to specify a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN/sup 2/) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed."
A theory for multiresolution signal decomposition: the wavelet representation,"S. G. Mallat, ",1989,10221,192463,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/192463/,"Multiresolution representations are effective for analyzing the information content of images. The properties of the operator which approximates a signal at a given resolution were studied. It is shown that the difference of information between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2/sup j+1/ and 2/sup j/ (where j is an integer) can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R/sup n/), the vector space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional functions. In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x). This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet representation lies between the spatial and Fourier domains. For images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial orientations. The application of this representation to data compression in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis is discussed.<>",Diffusion LMP algorithm with adaptive variable power,Code generator for implementing dual tree complex wavelet transform on reconfigurable architectures for mobile applications,High-frequency-based features for low and high retina haemorrhage classification,Motion artefact removals for wearable ECG using stationary wavelet transform,Fault detection classification and location for transmission lines and distribution systems: a review on the methods,Singular value decomposition and wavelet-based iris biometric watermarking,Robust transcale decentralised estimation fusion for multisensor systems based on wavelet packet decomposition,Addressing the illumination challenge in two-dimensional face recognition: a survey,Fusion of structural and textural features for melanoma recognition,Condition monitoring of 11 kV overhead power distribution line insulators using combined wavelet and LBP-HF features,Reduced memory low complexity embedded image compression algorithm using hierarchical listless discrete tchebichef transform,Medical image denoising by generalised Gaussian mixture modelling with edge information,Bayesian denoising of ultrasound images using heavy-tailed Levy distribution,Image segmentation framework based on multiple feature spaces,Content-based image retrieval using fuzzy class membership and rules based on classifier confidence,Sparse representation based on vector extension of reduced quaternion matrix for multiscale image denoising,Scheme for unsupervised colour–texture image segmentation using neutrosophic set and non-subsampled contourlet transform,Texture classification by multifractal spectrum and barycentric coordinates of bit planes of wavelet coefficients,Fast Coiflet magnetic field integral equation for scattering from open rough surfaces,Development of backscatter sounding single-site location system,Short-term forecasting of ionospheric total electron content over a low-latitude global navigation satellite system station,Real-time fault analysis of transmission lines using wavelet multi-resolution analysis based frequency-domain approach,Proposal of a novel fitness function for evaluation of wavelet shrinkage parameters on partial discharge denoising,Robust zero-point attraction least mean square algorithm on near sparse system identification,Comparative study of automatic speech recognition techniques,Robust transcale state estimation for multiresolution discrete-time systems based on wavelet transform,Improved sub-band adaptive thresholding function for denoising of satellite image based on evolutionary algorithms,Search of a robust defect signature in gear systems across adaptive Morlet wavelet of vibration signals,Transforming the SMV model into MMV model based on the characteristics of wavelet coefficients,Computing the proximity operator of the ℓ<sub>p</sub> norm with 0 &lt; p &lt; 1
Image quality assessment: from error visibility to structural similarity,"Zhou Wang, A. C. Bovik, H. R. Sheikh, E. P. Simoncelli, ",2004,8442,1284395,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1284395/,"Objective methods for assessing perceptual image quality traditionally attempted to quantify the visibility of errors (differences) between a distorted image and a reference image using a variety of known properties of the human visual system. Under the assumption that human visual perception is highly adapted for extracting structural information from a scene, we introduce an alternative complementary framework for quality assessment based on the degradation of structural information. As a specific example of this concept, we develop a structural similarity index and demonstrate its promise through a set of intuitive examples, as well as comparison to both subjective ratings and state-of-the-art objective methods on a database of images compressed with JPEG and JPEG2000.

"Stochastic Relaxation, Gibbs Distributions, and the Bayesian Restoration of Images","Stuart Geman, Donald Geman, ",1984,7900,4767596,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4767596/,"We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.",Automatic object segmentation of unstructured scenes using colour and depth maps,Bhattacharyya distance-based irregular pyramid method for image segmentation,Vertebral body segmentation using a probabilistic and universal shape model,A comparison of deep multilayer networks and Markov random field matching models for face recognition in the wild,Integrating wavelet transformation with Markov random field analysis for the depth estimation of light-field images,Image segmentation by a new weighted student's t-mixture model,Image segmentation by dirichlet process mixture model with generalised mean,Texture and edge preserving multiframe super-resolution,Synthetic aperture radar image segmentation using fuzzy label field-based triplet Markov fields model,Robust moving object detection using compressed sensing,Insights into prior learning for despeckling SAR images,A neural network architecture for preattentive vision,Entropy reduction and decorrelation in visual coding by oriented neural receptive fields,Multiple current dipole estimation using simulated annealing,A Bayesian approach to introducing anatomo-functional priors in the EEG/MEG inverse problem,Global optimization in the localization of neuromagnetic sources,Combined MEG and EEG source imaging by minimization of mutual information,Three-dimensional blind deconvolution of SPECT images,Bayesian analysis of blood glucose time series from diabetes home monitoring,A multiresolution framework to MEG/EEG source imaging,Bayesian approach to segmentation of statistical parametric maps,A sensor array processing approach to object region detection,Digital systems for artificial neural networks,On the RLSA antenna optimum design for DBS reception,Cooperative vision integration through data-parallel neural computations,Programmable BIST space compactors,A theoretical analysis of Monte Carlo algorithms for the simulation of Gibbs random field images,Recursive structure of noncausal Gauss-Markov random fields,A generalized wavelet transform for Fourier analysis: the multiresolution Fourier transform and its application to image and audio signal analysis,Vector quantization by deterministic annealing
A method for registration of 3-D shapes,"P. J. Besl, Neil D. McKay, ",1992,6192,121791,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/121791/,"The authors describe a general-purpose, representation-independent method for the accurate and computationally efficient registration of 3-D shapes including free-form curves and surfaces. The method handles the full six degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of 'shape complexity', one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model, prior to shape inspection. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces.<>",Efficient scaling registration algorithm for partially overlapping point sets,Place recognition for visual loop-closures using similarities of object graphs,Efficient scan matching method using direction distribution,Adaptive 3D object registration based on point cloud distribution for mobile robot,Point match refinement through rigidity constraint and vote,View planning method for complete 3D digitisation of the scene,Effective scaling registration approach by imposing emphasis on scale factor,Towards X-ray free endovascular interventions – using HoloLens for on-line holographic visualisation,3D ear recognition using global and local features,Vertical edge-based mapping using range-augmented omnidirectional vision sensor,Soft shape registration under lie group frame,Contour matching using the affine-invariant support point set,Adaptive face modelling for reconstructing 3D face shapes from single 2D images,Nose tip detection on three-dimensional faces using pose-invariant differential surface features,Improvement of affine iterative closest point algorithm for partial registration,Rigid blocks matching method based on contour curves and feature regions,Effective outlier matches pruning algorithm for rigid pairwise point cloud registration using distance disparity matrix,Robust registration of partially overlapping point sets via genetic algorithm with growth operator,Reference-omitted affine soft correspondence algorithm,System for quantitative three-dimensional echocardiography of the left ventricle based on a magnetic-field position and orientation sensing system,A computer-assisted range image registration system for nuclear waste cleanup,Meshsweeper: dynamic point-to-polygonal mesh distance and applications,High-quality texture reconstruction from multiple scans,Extracting objects from range and radiance images,Sensor modeling probabilistic hypothesis generation and robust localization for object recognition,A mechanism of automatic 3D object modeling,Recovering the position and orientation of free-form objects from image contours using 3D distance maps,A spherical representation for recognition of free-form surfaces,Registering multiview range data to create 3D computer objects,Towards a general multi-view registration technique
Eigenfaces vs. Fisherfaces: recognition using class specific linear projection,"P. N. Belhumeur, J. P. Hespanha, D. J. Kriegman, ",1997,5790,598228,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/598228/,"We develop a face recognition algorithm which is insensitive to large variation in lighting direction and facial expression. Taking a pattern classification approach, we consider each pixel in an image as a coordinate in a high-dimensional space. We take advantage of the observation that the images of a particular face, under varying illumination but fixed pose, lie in a 3D linear subspace of the high dimensional image space-if the face is a Lambertian surface without shadowing. However, since faces are not truly Lambertian surfaces and do indeed produce self-shadowing, images will deviate from this linear subspace. Rather than explicitly modeling this deviation, we linearly project the image into a subspace in a manner which discounts those regions of the face with large deviation. Our projection method is based on Fisher's linear discriminant and produces well separated classes in a low-dimensional subspace, even under severe variation in lighting and facial expressions. The eigenface technique, another method based on linearly projecting the image space to a low dimensional subspace, has similar computational requirements.

A tutorial on particle filters for online nonlinear/non-Gaussian Bayesian tracking,"M. S. Arulampalam, S. Maskell, N. Gordon, T. Clapp, ",2002,5062,978374,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/978374/,"Increasingly, for many application areas, it is becoming important to include elements of nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity in order to model accurately the underlying dynamics of a physical system. Moreover, it is typically crucial to process data on-line as it arrives, both from the point of view of storage costs as well as for rapid adaptation to changing signal characteristics. In this paper, we review both optimal and suboptimal Bayesian algorithms for nonlinear/non-Gaussian tracking problems, with a focus on particle filters. Particle filters are sequential Monte Carlo methods based on point mass (or ""particle"") representations of probability densities, which can be applied to any state-space model and which generalize the traditional Kalman filtering methods. Several variants of the particle filter such as SIR, ASIR, and RPF are introduced within a generic framework of the sequential importance sampling (SIS) algorithm. These are discussed and compared with the standard EKF through an illustrative example."
